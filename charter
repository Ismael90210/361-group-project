Additional meetings may be scheduled as needed during sprints. Team

notice is not possible, missing this meeting cannot be treated as a 
minor infraction. 

Team members will communicate absences or delays ahead of time, ideally 
at least 24 hours' notice. In case of extenuating circumstances, absent
team members must provide reasoning behind their absence. Unexcused 
absences not given reasoning will be treated as a minor infraction. 

Response to Communication:

Failure to do so without valid reasoning will be treated as a minor infraction.
